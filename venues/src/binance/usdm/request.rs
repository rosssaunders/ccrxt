HTTP Return Codes
HTTP 4XX return codes are used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
HTTP 403 return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
HTTP 409 return code is used when a cancelReplace order partially succeeds. (i.e. if the cancellation of the order fails but the new order placement succeeds.)
HTTP 429 return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
HTTP 418 return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving 429 codes.
HTTP 5XX return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side. It is important to NOT treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is UNKNOWN and could have been a success.

General Information on Endpoints
For GET endpoints, parameters must be sent as a query string.
For POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a query string or in the request body with content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. You may mix parameters between both the query string and request body if you wish to do so.
Parameters may be sent in any order.
If a parameter sent in both the query string and request body, the query string parameter will be used.
