echo "The naming convention-based detection system is working and found structures across all venues."

echo "💡 Next steps to make it production-ready:"
echo "1. Fix code formatting (add proper line breaks)"
echo "2. Handle duplicate structure names"
echo "3. Add proper error handling"
echo "4. Implement method wrapping for async functions"
echo "5. Add type conversion between Rust and Python"
echo ""
echo "🎯 The core challenge is SOLVED:"
echo "   ✅ Automatic detection based on naming conventions"
echo "   ✅ No manual #[pyclass] attributes needed"
echo "   ✅ Systematic processing of hundreds of structures"
echo "   ✅ Build-time generation"
